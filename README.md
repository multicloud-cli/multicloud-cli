Multicloud CLI has a simple & consistent syntax across the hybrid & multicloud.

We proudly leverage the great work of the [Apache Libcloud](https://libcloud.apache.org) project to abstract 
away the vendor specific API's so this project can focus on a CLI.  By levergaing `libcloud`, there is no need 
to install and configure each of your cloud vendors heavyweight SDK's in order to use this CLI.

Below is a sampling
of the Hybrid & Multicloud vendors we intend to support in the near future starting with AWS & LibVirt (KVM on localhost).
